*How to run the Game:*
------------------------
1. Open your choice of terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the game is downloaded in the terminal.
3. Plug in your UCFunkit.
4. Run the 'make program' command in the terminal.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the other UCFunkit.
Both boards now have the game flashed to memory, and should display the
starting screen ('PONG' should scroll across both screens).

*How to Play:*
------------------------
While at the start screen, ('PONG' will scroll across the screen) the speed can
be set by pressing the button. This will change the speed and set a
corresponding led: Off = Slow, Low = Medium, Bright = Fast. Default speed is
Slow. Each board can have a different speed setting, allowing for handicaps.
When the desired speed is set, pressing the navswitch down on both boards will
begin the game. First person to press the navswitch down will be required to
serve. This is done by again pressing the navswitch down. The direction of the
ball is dependent on the paddle: If the ball is aligned with the middle dot of
the paddle, or aligned off the paddle, the ball is served straight; if on the
left dot of the paddle the ball is served to the left or served right if aligned
with the right dot of the paddle.
After serving the game is live, and the ball will bounce across both screens.
The ball can be directed similarly to serving, except if the ball misses the
paddle, the game will end and a 'W' will be displayed on the winners board,
while a 'L' will be displayed for the loser.
After a few seconds the game will reset to the start screen and a new game can
be started.
